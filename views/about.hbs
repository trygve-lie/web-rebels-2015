    <h2>About the web design</h2>
    <p>We hired <a href="https://twitter.com/elisabethirg">Elisabeth Irgens</a> as our designer for the 2nd year in a row. She has been responsible for design, HTML and CSS. This time, we finally turned her into a <a href="http://github.com/elisabethirgens">GitHub user</a> â€“ very practical if you want her to design your web projects.</p>
