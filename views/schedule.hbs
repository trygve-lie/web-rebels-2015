    <h2 class="ratherloud-heading">Wednesday 20 May</h2>
    <p>Pre-conference party with <a href="/openmic">Open Mic</a> sessions at the <a href="http://vbarogbistro.no/">V Bar &amp; Restaurant</a>.
        During this evening you can exchange your ticket into the conference pass, giving you more time to focus on breakfast than queuing for access on Thursday morning. Nice eh?</p>
